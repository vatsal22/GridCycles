# GridCycle
A game that me and a friend made using Java. Think of it as a bigger and better "Tron".
We spent the better half of a year working on it.

If you want to play it, just download the entire GridCycles folder and run the .exe (don't worry about the .java files at the top. They're already included in the folder)
